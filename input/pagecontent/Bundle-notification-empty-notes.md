In order to satisfy the requirements of a `history` Bundle (specifically `bdl-3` and `bdl-4`), note that `Bundle.entry.request` must exist.

For the status resource (`entry[0]`), the request is filled out to match a request to the `$status` operation.

Since this is an `empty` notification and does not include additional entries, no additional constraints are imposed by `Bundle` requirements.
